# ClinicProjectAndroid

This application is for patients of clinic. They can create or dismiss a new record to the doctor, can browse created records, they can search doctors, can read the information about doctor, read the information about clinic (phone numbers, nearest transport, the point on GoogleMaps), also they can read the information about yourself (current diagnosis and medication) and look for previous diagnoses. The application has settings where you can change interface language, change text size and allow gestures control for GoogleMap.
This is just a diploma project and it can't be a commercial application. 

But it's good demonstration of my knowlage and skills in programming.
